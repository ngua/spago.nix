* Why does changing the ~dependencies~ in my ~spago.dhall~ rebuild /all/ dependencies?
Currently, all of the project's dependencies are compiled together and re-used in later derivations. I haven't found a way to compile individual dependencies without triggering later rebuilds (~purs~ tracks rebuilds by comparing timestamps and hashes in a JSON file stored in ~output~). This /should/ be theoretically possible and may be implemented in the future.
